Probably this is like operations in abstract algebra. For instance in a set (in this case a list) of
numbers where the operation is a + there will be an inverse element and an identity element. In the 
operation + the inverse is minus of a number in the set and identity is 0 such that adding 0 to that 
number doesn't change anything.
